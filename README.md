# File Storage System
A simple file storage system built with Express.js, EJS, and Tailwind CSS. This project allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their files and folders. It uses PostgreSQL for data storage and integrates with Cloudinary for file storage.

**A local database system was used due to database limit constraints using Render so a Live Demo is not available.**
